How to contribute
=================

We gladly accept outside contributions. We use our
`Github issue tracker <https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea/issues>`_
for both discussions and talking about new features or bugs. You can
also fork the project and send us a pull request. If you have a more
general topic to discuss, the `dev-geolocation@lists.mozilla.org
<https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-geolocation>`_
mailing list is a good place to do so. You can sometimes find us on
IRC in the `#geo channel on irc.mozilla.org <https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC>`_.


Development
===========

If you want to work on the code and sent us a
`pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_,
first fork the repository on github to your own account. Then clone
your new repository and `follow the installation instructions
<https://mozilla.github.io/ichnaea/install/index.html>`_.
While working on the code, the `testing instructions
<https://mozilla.github.io/ichnaea/install/testing.html>`_
should come in handy.


Legal
=====

Currently we don't have any legal contributor agreement, so code
ownership stays with the original authors. The project is licensed
under the `Apache License Version 2
<https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.
